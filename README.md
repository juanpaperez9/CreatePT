The program serves as a gym management software designed to register new users. It offers four types of subscriptions: DA, CF, CO, and E. Upon registration, the user provides their first and last name along with their socioeconomic stratum. They are then prompted to select their desired subscription type.

Based on the chosen subscription, the program applies specific discounts. Users belonging to strata 1 and 2 are eligible for discounts in certain subscription types. The program also displays pertinent messages regarding upcoming alliances for certain subscription types.

After registration, the program presents a summary of the user's data, including the subscription type, duration, and accumulated points. Additionally, it calculates the subtotal before tax, applies applicable discounts, and displays the total amount to pay after tax.

Should the user opt to exit, the program returns to the main menu for further interactions.
